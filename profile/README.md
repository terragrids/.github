## MVP Analysis 
We evaluated each focus area against factors like data availability, urgency, costs, stakeholder engagement, and existing solutions.

In the UK, the government’s [adaptation framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/climate-adaptation-research-and-innovation-framework/climate-adaptation-research-and-innovation-framework) highlights sectors such as food security, health and community resilience. New national datasets (e.g. the [BGS GeoCoast coastal database](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/news/bgs-launches-new-coastal-datasets-to-inform-coastal-management-planning-and-adaptation-in-the-face-of-climate-change/)) are being published.

The US has analogous programs ([USDA](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/general-information/staff-offices/office-chief-economist/office-energy-and-environmental-policy/climate-change/climate-change-adaptation) and [NOAA climate adaptation plans](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/coastalresilience.html)), and Western Europe benefits from EU-supported climate services (e.g. the [H2020 CoCliCo coastal project](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/projects/coastal-climate-core-services) and the [European Climate & Health Observatory](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en)).

Based on these inputs, the table below qualitatively rates the success likelihood of a research/nonprofit-led MVP in each domain over the next 12 months.

## Table: Likelihood of Success by Region

| **Area**              | **UK (Pilot)** | **US (Secondary)** | **Western Europe (Tertiary)** |
|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Coastal Adaptation** | **High** – Rich geodata, policy support ([GeoCoast](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/news/bgs-launches-new-coastal-datasets-to-inform-coastal-management-planning-and-adaptation-in-the-face-of-climate-change/)), R&D priorities | **Medium** – Agencies offer tools (e.g. [Coastal Resilience Mapping](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/coastalresilience.html)), but MVP must find a niche | **Medium** – EU-funded projects like [CoCliCo](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/projects/coastal-climate-core-services), but coordination and legacy systems add complexity |
| **Agriculture / Rural** | **High** – UK promoting adaptation; strong data networks ([EU/JRC agro datasets](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/agri4cast)) | **High** – [USDA](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/general-information/staff-offices/office-chief-economist/office-energy-and-environmental-policy/climate-change/climate-change-adaptation) supports farmers; urgency from extreme events | **High** – EU’s CAP & [JRC data](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/agri4cast), but cross-country alignment needed |
| **Disaster Response**  | **Medium** – Rich historical data ([EM-DAT](https://www.emdat.be/)), but fewer major disasters | **High** – Frequent disasters drive funding; strong data/tools (FEMA, NOAA, EM-DAT) | **Medium** – Events increasing; fragmented governance slows coordination |
| **Health & Climate**   | **Medium** – Heat impacts urgent (e.g. ~3,000 deaths in 2022), but health data is complex | **Medium** – [CDC tools](https://www.cdc.gov/climate-health/php/resources/data-and-tools.html) exist, but privacy concerns | **Medium** – [EU Observatory](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en), but limited coordination/data sharing |

## Summary

- Ratings (**High/Medium/Low**) reflect qualitative synthesis.
- **UK** scores high for **Coastal Adaptation** due to strong data and policy.
- **Health & Climate** rated medium across all regions due to urgent needs but practical hurdles.
