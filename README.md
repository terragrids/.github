# Welcome to Terragrids
## TL;DR
[Terragrids](https://terragrids.org) is a web3 crowd-funding platform for community renewable energy projects. 

The online platform is a game built on top of the Algorand blockchain. It runs a small metaverse, where participants can explore, build and develop a sustainable town entirely powered by solar energy. 

Players buy NFTs to build what they need to develop their projects in the metaverse. The revenues from the purchase of each NFT will be administered in the Terragrids treasury Algorand wallet and will directly contribute to the planning and delivery of community renewable energy projects run in partnership with local NGOs.

NFTs will give players governance rights in the management of the Terragrids metaverse, gradually developing Terragrids into a DAO.
